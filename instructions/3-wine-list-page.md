# Wine list page

Creating the `WineListPage` component is exactly the same as creating the `RegionsPage` component:
* fetch data from the API,
* manage clics on the wines to navigate to the wine details page.

Remember, `WineListPage` is a *Smart Component* (it uses its `state`) and `WineList` must not be modified (it is a *Dumb Component* that only uses its props).

The component tree should look like:

No more help here because it is quite easy to create the `WineListPage` component :wink:

## What's next

When it works, go to the [next step](./4-wine-details-page.md) to create the `WinePage` component.
